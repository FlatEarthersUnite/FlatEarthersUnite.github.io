<h1 class="Page1h1">Flat Earth Image</h1>

<p id="p1b1">
    If you’ve made it this far, you’re ready to get down to the nitty gritty of the flat earth conspiracy theory.

The theory begins with the premise that the earth is a disc, with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica wrapped all the way around the edge, as seen above. Antarctica itself is a 150 foot wall of ice which is the first barrier to the edge of the earth, acting as a container for all of the earth’s water. The second and final barrier is the dome, which holds the sun, the moon, and all of the stars, and also prevents anyone from falling off the edge. The last part of the theory is that gravity is an illusion. Instead of objects being pulled downward, the disc of the earth is actually being pushed upward as a result of universal acceleration.

The first piece of scientific information supporting the flat earth theory arose from the Bedford Level experiment in 1838. In this experiment, Samuel Birley Rowbotham set out to measure the exact curvature of the earth by watching a boat float away from his fixed position. Based on the curve of the earth, the boat should not have been visible after it travelled more than six miles, yet it was, leading to the conclusion that the earth is not a globe.

    Many people believe the earth was created as a result of the Big Bang. However, based on the readings of the Bible, God created a flat, dome like, earth. The denial of this is the denial of God, which serves to maintain the state as the holder of all control by dismissing religion.
    Some key Bible verses include:
    
    “He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” (Isaiah 40:22)
    
    “After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.” (Revelation 7:1)
    
    “Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.” (Matthew 4:8)

        Theory #2

        There are continents past Antarctica, which is where the most rich and powerful people live. The government doesn’t want anyone to find out about this, which is why NASA protects the ice wall separating us from them. This also explains why Liberals are pushing the climate change agenda – because if the ice wall melts, the other continents would be visible and accessible to all, exposing the world’s elite.
